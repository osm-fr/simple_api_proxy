== What it does ==
In a few words "why" :

The main API server is applying sanity restrictions in order to limit per
IP, 
per area or per elapsed time calls sent to it. This simple proxy is reducing 
such calls by answering the data request calls itself.

In a few words "how" :

When handeling a request,  any of map, node, way, relation, nodes, ways, 
relations and capabilities GET calls are converted to the overpass API 
syntaxe and forwarded to a local (or even could do to a distant) overpass
API 
server.
When handeling any other PUT, POST, DELETE, WHATEVER or GET requests, it 
forwards the call to the 0.6 API dev server acting as a transparent proxy as 
much as possible.
Advantage beeing that no modifications are needed in the client if it
supports 
the 0.6 API (beside changing the target URL of course)

note: Your credentials are clear text transmitted to the proxy server
